DH protocol:
  -no mechanism to authenticate parties
DH with certificates:
 -mitm wont be able to sign the screct signing key

least privilege
  -will only access what is necessary
separation of privileges
  -program splits into parts, one is doing work requiring privileges and other is not
  
dos
  -SYN flooding, send packets without processing ACK, bandwitch is small, attacker is small
  -spoofing, send on behalf of someone else
  -smurfing, attacker sends ICMP requests (pings) to the networks broadcast address of a router configured to relay
    ICMPs to all devices behind the router
  -DNS resolver, ask him on behalf of victim about about the address of something, huge response for a small querry
    can use list of known DNS resolvers to drop them
    
firewall
  -divide trusted interior of a network from untrusted outside
  -less pos for compromise: no compilers linkers libraries ...
  -few accounts
  -physical divider if hardware router
  -set of rules
  -can also route
  -OSI level 3 required to read IP
  -stateless just check ip/port of connections
  -statefull can check if remote starts ssending packets to many ports (port scan), when over threshold fk him up
  -application proxy OSI 7, simulates requests, now certain application requests can be blocked:
    -block web traffic containing certain words
    -prevent anything looking like a credit card from leaving db
  -personal, basic can be disabled partially or fully
